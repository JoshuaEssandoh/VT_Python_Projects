# Python Projects
This is for our python projects, yall know what it is

## Pong game
Our end goal is to do sumthn with image processing and classificaiton so we can use those skills for sum AR/VR work, 
but as a warm up, we'lll start with a game of pong
### First Phase 
To start out, I copied a file of a pong game already made in python "Pong BUt better.py", We'll comment on this file(in GitHub, VSCode, or IDE(Integrated Development Environment) of your choice) it understand what every action and function does.
If u do choose to use GitHub, u can also save a copy for a clean slate
### Second Phase 
After we comment on all the functions and stuff, we can choose to do two projects, a few I got in mind are 4 pongs(? the thing u hit the ball with) on each side, 2 seperate games on one screen, and a best-of-5 system.

After we finish with those we'll start the image stuff.
